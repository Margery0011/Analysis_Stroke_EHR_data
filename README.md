# Analysis within EHR Stroke data

This is my PM566 final project.

Updated after getting advice from Assignment 5.

- Removed data cleaning from your website and just focus on the data and results.
- Round decimals in Tables in my Report
- Removed duplicated Figure 5
- Fixed the link and navigation bar


In this study, I want to explore the association between average glucose level value and stroke, also I am wondering if there is any relationship between age and BMI with average glucose level. It can be stepped down as the following questionsï¼š

- 1. What it the density of age among stroke patients and non-stroke patients ?
- 2. What it the density of average glucose level among stroke patients and non-stroke patients ?
- 3. What it the distribution of average glucose level among stroke patients and non-stroke patients in different age level ?
- 4. What it the distribution of average glucose level among stroke patients and non-stroke patients in different obesity level?
- 5. Is there significant difference of average glucose level between stroke patients and non-stroke patients?
- 6. Is there significant difference of age between stroke patients and non-stroke patients?
- 7. Is there significant difference of bmi value glucose level between stroke patients and non-stroke patients?
- 8. Is there significant difference between stroke patients and non-stroke in each age level?
- 9. Is there significant difference between stroke patients and non-stroke patients in each obesity level ?

Here is my Github Page: [website](https://margery0011.github.io/Analysis_Stroke_EHR_data/index.html)

Here is the link to the report [report](https://github.com/Margery0011/Analysis_Stroke_EHR_data/blob/main/Report.pdf)

You can download it from this link [Download Report](Report.pdf)

Datasets are in the repository and the summary of them are stored in the `data` [folder](https://github.com/Margery0011/Analysis_Stroke_EHR_data/tree/main/data)

Note: You can click the `Table` button at the top to see the three summary tables on the Table page and click the `Wilcoxon Test` button to check for the significant test. Sometimes it takes time to load the page and please use **Open the link in a new tab** to see these additional pages in case there might be some loading problems, thanks.
